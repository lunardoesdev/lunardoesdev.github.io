Your HTTP server is a system. Your deployment pipeline is a system. A distributed microservice architecture is a system of systems.\nWhen something breaks, the question is always: which state changed unexpectedly, and which transition caused it?"

    "text": "The trick\nMost debugging goes wrong because people look at the symptoms directly. They search for the error message, find a Stack Overflow post from 2018, apply the suggested fix, and move on if it works.\nThat approach fails on novel bugs — and increasingly, the easy bugs are already fixed.\nThe better approach: ignore the error message first. Ask instead:\n\nWhat was the expected state at this point?\nWhat is the actual state?\nWhere did those two diverge?\n\nOnce you’ve identified the divergence, the cause is usually nearby."

    "section": "Building the habit",
    "text": "Building the habit\nThe habit is just asking “what changed?” before “what’s the error?”. It sounds obvious but takes practice to default to.\nWrite down your mental model before you start investigating. It forces you to make your assumptions explicit — and explicit assumptions are much easier to test."
