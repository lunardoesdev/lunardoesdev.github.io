There's a kind of developer who can walk into any codebase and, within an hour, have a mental model good enough to find bugs reliably. They don't have memorized APIs or encyclopedic language knowledge. What they have is a way of thinking about *systems*.

## What a system is

A system is anything with:

- **State** — things that can change
- **Transitions** — rules for how state changes
- **Boundaries** — what's inside vs. outside

Your database is a system. Your HTTP server is a system. Your deployment pipeline is a system. A distributed microservice architecture is a system of systems.

When something breaks, the question is always: *which state changed unexpectedly, and which transition caused it?*

## The trick

Most debugging goes wrong because people look at the symptoms directly. They search for the error message, find a Stack Overflow post from 2018, apply the suggested fix, and move on if it works.

That approach fails on novel bugs — and increasingly, the easy bugs are already fixed.

The better approach: ignore the error message first. Ask instead:

1. What was the expected state at this point?
2. What is the actual state?
3. Where did those two diverge?

Once you've identified the divergence, the cause is usually nearby.

## Building the habit

The habit is just asking "what changed?" before "what's the error?". It sounds obvious but takes practice to default to.

Write down your mental model before you start investigating. It forces you to make your assumptions explicit — and explicit assumptions are much easier to test.
