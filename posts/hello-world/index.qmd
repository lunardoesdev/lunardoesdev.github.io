Every blog needs a first post. This is mine.

## What this is

I've been meaning to write publicly for a while. Not to build an audience or grow a brand — just to have a place to put thoughts that are too long for a comment thread and too short to be a proper article.

The topics will mostly be code-adjacent: things I've built, problems I've run into, approaches I find interesting. Occasionally something further afield.

## What to expect

Posts here will be short and irregular. I'd rather write something small and honest than wait for a "real" post that never comes.

If something here is wrong or you have a better way, feel free to reach out.

```python
# Start somewhere
print("Hello, world.")
```

That's it. More soon.
