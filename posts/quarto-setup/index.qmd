Since this is a developer blog, it seems right to write about how it's built.

## The stack

- **[Quarto](https://quarto.org)** — static site generator with first-class support for code, notebooks, and technical writing
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting
- **Custom CSS** — theme overrides on top of Quarto's `cosmo` base

No JavaScript frameworks, no build pipeline, no node_modules folder of shame.

## Why Quarto

I wanted something that handles code blocks well by default, can render math if I ever need it, and doesn't require me to fight the tooling to write a simple post.

Quarto fits. It's opinionated enough to get out of the way, but extensible enough that I could build exactly the listing style I wanted.

## The listing page

Quarto's default post listing moves the title around depending on whether there's a thumbnail image. I didn't want that. A custom [EJS](https://ejs.co/) template gives full control over the HTML:

```
listing:
  template: listing.ejs
  fields: [date, title, description, categories]
```

The template is about 20 lines of straightforward HTML with EJS interpolation.

## Search

Full-text search comes for free with Quarto — just set `type: overlay` in the search config and it indexes all your content automatically using [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/).

```yaml
search:
  location: navbar
  type: overlay
```

That's most of it. The rest is CSS.
